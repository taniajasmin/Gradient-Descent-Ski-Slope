# Gradient-Descent-Ski-Slope

An interactive educational game that demonstrates the gradient descent optimization algorithm through a snowboarding simulation.

## Core Logic
**Terrain as Loss Function:** The mountain slope represents a loss landscape with varying gradients
**Learning Rate as Speed Control:** Player adjusts learning rate to control snowboarder's momentum and speed
**Physics-Based Feedback:** Real-time visualization of how learning rate affects convergence/divergence
**Obstacles as Local Minima:** Holes and terrain features simulate optimization challenges

## Why It's Important
- Makes abstract ML concepts tangible through interactive gameplay
- Demonstrates the critical balance in choosing learning rates
- Shows consequences of optimization choices in real-time
- Provides intuitive understanding before diving into mathematical formulations

## Relevant Fields
**Machine Learning Education:** Teaching gradient descent and optimization
**Neural Network Training:** Understanding hyperparameter tuning
**Data Science:** Foundational concept for model training
**Educational Technology:** Gamification of complex STEM concepts

## Key Takeaway
Just like a snowboarder needs the right speed to navigate terrain efficiently, machine learning algorithms need appropriate learning rates to find optimal solutions without overshooting or getting stuck.
